# The mosaic ancesty of wheat genome project

This repo contains customized codes used in the mosaic ancesty wheat genome project. Codes are grouped into multiple folders according to their usage. Appropriate comments and user manuals have been added within these scripts. A README file is provided including the descriptions of each folder.

## Brief description of code in each folder
**Genetic_distance_distribution_modeling:**
Fit Gaussian distributions on the genetic distance distribution in the A&B subgenome, and D subgenome of wheat using Expectation-Maximum (EM) algorithm.

**AHG_based_phylogeny:**
Construct phylogeneitc tree based on the genome-wide AHG type differences.

**Saturation_test_of_AHGs:**
Saturation test of unique AHG types number for different number of samples.

**Pericentromere_positioning:**
Positioning Pericentromeric reigon based on the rate of transition among AHG types between adjacent windows.

**3B_PAH_geographical_diversificaiton:**
Geographical distribution and spreading route reconstruction of 3B PAHs.
